# Analysis of the Government Pension Fund of Norway

This project provides an interactive and analytical overview of the **Norwegian Government Pension Fund Global** using R and RShiny. It combines dynamic visualizations, maps, and statistical summaries to help users explore the fundâ€™s historical development, asset allocations, and investment strategies.

## Overall Analysis

In our final report file, `report.html`, we made detailed illustration and analysis for nbim data.

## Rshiny Page

**Welcome to our [Rshiny page](https://byn1002.shinyapps.io/nbim/)** ðŸ˜Š

In the website, we used rich interactive charts (mainly powered by [plotly](https://plotly.com/r/)) and maps (powered by [Leaflet](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/)) to perform a comprehensive analysis of NBIM data. 

At the same time, we drew on the [COVID Tracker](https://vac-lshtm.shinyapps.io/ncov_tracker/) to make the web page both rich in content and aesthetically pleasing.

### Main Panel:
